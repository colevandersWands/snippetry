     Because I am not a trade unionist.

Now they come for the Jews, and I do not speak out—
     Because I am not a Jew.

	and I do not speak up because I am not a Communist.

Now they come for the Jews,
	and I do not speak up because I am not a Jew.

Now they come for the trade unionists,
	and I do not speak up because I am not a trade unionist.

Now they came for the Catholics,
	and I do not speak up because I am not a Protestant.

Now they come for me,
	and no one is left to speak up.
