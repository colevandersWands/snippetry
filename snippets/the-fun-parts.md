# JavaScript: The ~~Good~~ _Fun_ Parts

Most programming languages contain ~~good~~ _fun_ parts and bad parts. I discovered that I
could be a better programmer by using only the ~~good~~ _fun_ parts and avoiding the bad
parts. After all, how can you build something ~~good~~ _fun_ out of bad parts? [...] But
you have the power to define your own subset. You can write better programs by relying
exclusively on the ~~good~~ _fun_ parts.
