First they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out—
     Because I was not a socialist.

Then they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out—
     Because I was not a trade unionist.

Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—
     Because I was not a Jew.

Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.

They came first for the Communists,
	and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Communist.

Then they came for the Jews,
	and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Jew.

Then they came for the trade unionists,
	and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a trade unionist.

Then they came for the Catholics,
	and I didn't speak up because I was a Protestant.

Then they came for me,
	and by that time no one was left to speak up.
