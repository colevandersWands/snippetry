# Garden

This poem uses the metaphor of a garden to explore the organic nature of code and knowledge management, particularly in the context of Snippetry's interconnected system.

## Metaphors

- **Garden/Tree**: The codebase/knowledge base as a living, growing system
- **Leaves**: Individual snippets of code or knowledge
- **Branches**: Links and relationships between pieces of content
- **Roots**: Foundational concepts and deep understanding
- **Seeds**: New ideas and code fragments that can grow into full features
- **Pruning**: Refactoring and maintenance
- **Seasons/Growth**: The natural cycles of development and learning

## Structure

The poem is organized in four stanzas, each exploring a different aspect of development:
1. The fundamental structure (tree of knowledge)
2. The spread of ideas (seeds of code)
3. The maintenance process (pruning and tending)
4. The continuous evolution (endless possibility)

## Technical Connection

This poem reflects Snippetry's core concepts:
- Interconnected content (branches/links)
- Organic knowledge growth
- The importance of maintenance and documentation
- The cyclical nature of development

Written as a plain text poem that serves as a metappet, reflecting on the nature of code and knowledge management.
