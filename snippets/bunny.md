# 🐰

> If drawing rabbits (🐇) in JavaScript means copying
> [patterns out of books](./the-fun-parts.md) or mimicking specific styles from blogs,
> drawing bunnies (🐰) is about experimentation and creative expression
>
> To draw a 🐰 is to pervert the conventions of the language. To draw your breath or to
> get it all out as fast as possible. It’s an exercise in discovering and pushing the
> bounds of your understanding of the language. It’s about reinforcing and challenging
> JavaScript as a craft.
>
> In drawing JavaScript 🐰s, you’re always at play. And you’re getting better.
