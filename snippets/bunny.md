# 🐰

If drawing rabbits (🐇) in JavaScript means copying
[patterns out of books](./the-fun-parts.md) or mimicking specific styles from blogs,
drawing bunnies (🐰) is about experimentation and creative expression

To draw a 🐰 is to pervert the conventions of the language. To draw your breath or to get
it all out as fast as possible. It’s an exercise in discovering and pushing the bounds of
your understanding of the language. It’s about reinforcing and challenging JavaScript as a
craft.

In drawing JavaScript 🐰s, you’re always at play. And you’re getting better.
