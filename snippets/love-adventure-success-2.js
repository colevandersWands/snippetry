// Once upon a time, in a land of code,
// A variable named 'dreams' was bestowed.
let dreams = [];

// With each passing day, new dreams were found,
// And into the array, they were tightly bound.
dreams.push('love');
dreams.push('adventure');
dreams.push('success');

// But as time went on, the dreams grew old,
// And their true meaning began to unfold.
let reality = dreams.map((dream) => dream.toLowerCase());

// The dreams were transformed, no longer the same,
// As reality played its mysterious game.
let illusion = reality.reverse();

// And in the end, what was once so clear,
// Became a puzzle, filled with fear.
let puzzle = illusion.join('');

// But fear not, for within the code,
// Lies the answer, waiting to be showed.
console.log(puzzle);
