Dweets are wrapped in a function named `u` that's called 60 times per second. You can use
these variables:

- `t`: elapsed time in seconds.
- `c`: A 1920x1080 canvas.
- `x`: A 2D context for that canvas.
- `S`: Math.sin
- `C`: Math.cos
- `T`: Math.tan
- `R`: Generates rgba-strings, ex.: R(255, 255, 255, 0.5)
