// In the realm of code, a story unfolds
// A tale of mystery, where secrets are told

// Once upon a time, in a land of arrays
// Lived a programmer, lost in a coding maze

// With variables and functions, the story began
// Each line of code, a step in the plan

const journey = () => {
  // In the depths of the code, a riddle awaits
  const riddle = "What has keys but can't open gates?";

  // A quest for answers, the programmer embarks
  const answer = 'A keyboard, where creativity sparks';

  // But the path is not easy, challenges arise
  const obstacles = ['Syntax errors', 'Bugs in disguise'];

  // With each obstacle faced, the programmer learns
  // Debugging skills, the fire that burns

  for (let i = 0; i < obstacles.length; i++) {
    // The programmer fights, with determination and might
    // Seeking the truth, in the code's darkest night

    console.log(`Obstacle ${i + 1}: ${obstacles[i]}`);
    // The console reveals, the errors to see
    // Line by line, the programmer sets free

    // But the journey continues, the story unwinds
    // Seeking perfection, in the code that binds
    if (i === obstacles.length - 1) {
      // Victory is near, the final test awaits
      console.log("Congratulations! You've reached the gates");
    }
  }
};

// The journey begins, the code comes alive
journey();
