in my garden
grows a tree of knowledge
  each leaf a snippet
  each branch a link
  roots deep in thought
  reaching through soil of experience

when ideas bloom
they scatter seeds of code
  some take root
  some float away
  all part of the
  greater growing

pruning and tending
the digital green
  refactoring branches
  documenting growth
  watching patterns emerge
  in the canopy of concepts

this garden is alive
with endless possibility
  each commit a season
  each merge a grafting
  nurturing the future
  one snippet at a time
