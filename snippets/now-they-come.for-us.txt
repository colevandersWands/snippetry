		Even though you are not an asylum seeker.

Then they came for illegal residents, and you spoke out —
		Even though you are not an illegal resident.

Then they came for international students, and you spoke out —
		Even though you are not an international student.

		Even though you are not a greencard holder.

Then they came for naturalized citizens, and you spoke out —
		Even though you are not a naturalized citizen.
