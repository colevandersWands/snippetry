First they came for asylum seekers, and you did not speak out —
		Because you are not an asylum seeker.

Then they came for illegal residents, and you did not speak out —
		Because you are not an illegal resident.

Then they came for international students, and you did not speak out —
		Because you are not an international student.

Then they came for greencard holders, and you did not speak out —
		Because you are not a greencard holder.

Then they came for naturalized citizens, and you did not speak out —
		Because you are not a naturalized citizen.


Now they come for you — and there is no one left to speak for you.
