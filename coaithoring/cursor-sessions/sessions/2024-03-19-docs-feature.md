# Session: 2024-03-19 - First `.docs.` Implementation

## Context
First session after `prepairadise` tag, marking transition to AI collaboration.

## Session Goals
1. Implement `.docs.` feature for documentation relationships
2. Create first AI contribution
3. Establish collaboration patterns

## Technical Analysis

### Project Architecture Review
- Backend: Node.js-based build system for processing snippets
- Frontend: Custom component system for rendering snippets
- Key concepts: metalinks, forelinks, aftlinks, subtexts
- Extensible file type system using extensions for semantic meaning

### Areas for Improvement
1. Code Organization
   - Processing pipeline could be modularized
   - Utility functions need centralization
   - Error handling needs enhancement

2. Performance Considerations
   - Multiple iterations over snippets array
   - Relationship lookup efficiency
   - Frontend state management

### Expansion Opportunities
See [Expansion Ideas](../musings/expansion-opportunities.md)

## Contributions

### Garden Metappet
Created metaphorical reflection on code and knowledge:
- `snippets/garden.txt` - Poem about code as a growing garden
- `snippets/garden.txt.docs.md` - Metaphor explanations
- Tagged with: `AIthored, metappet`

### `.docs.` Feature
See detailed spec: [Docs Feature](../features/docs-feature.md)

## Next Steps
- Complete `.docs.` feature implementation
- Test with various documentation formats
- Consider expansion opportunities
