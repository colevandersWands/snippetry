# #16

For Taper #16, we invite submissions in response to the theme “For Good Measure.” The
number 16 is an instrumental base for many standards and measures. The hexadecimal or hex
(16 digit) number system underpins binary encodings on the web, including in the 162
web-safe colors and UTF-16 character encodings. Sixteen bars measure the space to spit a
verse; Edgar Allen Poe’s The Raven takes flight in octameter, or 16-syllable lines. The 16
pieces on each side of the chess board, governed by a rigid ruleset, allow for vast
permutations of gameplay. Labor movements around the world have long fought to take
measures toward a balanced 16-hour waking life: “Eight hours for work, eight hours for
rest, and eight hours for what you will.” The 16 ounces in a pint and a pound invoke
translations between historic Imperial measurements and the metric systems of Napoleonic
rationalization. With them, cooks, bakers, and brewers may scoop, weigh, and calculate
ingredients to the decimal point, but also sharpen artisanal intuitions beyond measure. We
welcome poetic explorations with(in) systems of quantification, and engagements with how
such structures make way for emergence and freedoms outside their lines.
